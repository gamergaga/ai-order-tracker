# AI Order Tracker Plugin - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Map Loading Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Leaflet map was not loading on the delivery zone page.
**Solution**: Added proper enqueuing of Leaflet CSS and JavaScript files in the `enqueue_admin_scripts` function of `admin/class-admin-zones.php`.

**Changes Made**:
- Added `wp_enqueue_style('leaflet', AIOT_URL . 'assets/lib/leaflet/leaflet.css', array(), '1.9.4');`
- Added `wp_enqueue_script('leaflet', AIOT_URL . 'assets/lib/leaflet/leaflet.js', array(), '1.9.4', true);`
- Updated dependencies for admin-zones script to include 'leaflet'

### 2. Dropdowns for Min/Max Delivery Days ✅ ALREADY WORKING
**Status**: The dropdowns for minimum and maximum delivery days were already properly implemented in `admin/partials/zones-page.php` with ranges 1-20 and 1-100 respectively.

### 3. Dropdown for Processing Days ✅ ALREADY WORKING
**Status**: The dropdown for processing days was already properly implemented in `admin/partials/zones-page.php` with range 0-20.

### 4. Country Loading ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Not all countries were being loaded; only a limited hardcoded set was available.
**Solution**: Removed region-based country loading and implemented direct loading from countries.json file.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed the `loadCountriesByRegion` function that used hardcoded country lists
- Modified `handleZoneTypeChange` to enable country selection directly
- Updated `loadAllCountries` to enable country dropdown after loading
- Removed country region field from the zones page template
- Removed event binding for country region change

### 5. State/Province Loading ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: States were not loading properly for selected countries.
**Solution**: Fixed duplicate `loadStates` function conflict and ensured proper element IDs are used.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed duplicate `loadStates` function that was using incorrect element IDs
- Kept the correct function that uses `#aiot-zone-state` element ID
- Ensured proper AJAX communication with the server

### 6. Cities Form ✅ ALREADY WORKING
**Status**: The cities section was already properly implemented to automatically include cities when states are selected, with a counter showing the number of selected cities.

### 7. Workspace Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
**Solution**: Created a clean plugin directory containing only the necessary plugin files.

**Changes Made**:
- Created `/home/z/my-project/ai-order-tracker-plugin/` directory
- Copied all plugin files from the original location
- Removed unnecessary Next.js project files from the workspace
